            <h1>Preparation</h1>
            
            <ol class="fancy">
              <li>Review your planning and facilitation materials.</li>
              <li>Review this activity before you run it.</li>
              <li>Gather your materials.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Hack Your Nametag &amp; Intros</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

            <p>Ask participants to create a nametag to wear during the event that captures an exhibit or performance project idea they have in support of common-sense copyright reform. Each participant can put their name and handle on one side and a question or project idea they have on the other. Then they can use your crafting materials to illustrate and/or illuminate either side or both sides with provided materials.</p>
            
            <p>With the next 5 minutes of the activity, participants go in a circle introducing themselves by sharing their names and questions or ideas with the group.</p>  
            
            <p>Finally, introduce the campaign with this <a href="https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/encrypt/codemoji/1">explainer video from Mozilla</a>.</p>

            <h1>Contributing Photos to the Commons</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">40 minutes</div>

            <p>With the first 10 minutes of this activity, use slides or campaign materials to introduce the idea of the commons - content we can all use freely in our lives and work. Explain how copyright law can imperil the commons by</p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>Copyrighting parts of public spaces so people cannot photograph them or reproduce them in other ways.</li>
              <li>Extending the copyright terms of popular brands so that the public can never use them without fear of being sued by corporations (e.g. the song “Happy Birthday” is copyrighted and cannot be used in films, tv, etc without paying a fee).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Ask participants what they think fair copyright terms are. Then share local terms with them and invite their responses.</p>
            
            <p>Next, invite attendees to contribute to the commons by collecting and sharing images of their home community. Give participants 25-30 minutes to go out of the event space and take 5-10 photos of buildings, public art installments, graffiti and other such notable landmarks in their neighborhood.</p>
            
            <p>When participants return, review local “freedom of panorama” rules.</p>
            
            <p>You can start learning more about freedom of panorama policies in Europe by sharing the explainer video <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FixCopyright-_Copy_explains_%27Freedom_of_Panorama%27.webm">here</a>.
            
            <p>Some countries in the EU make it illegal to take pictures of copyrighted works in public spaces, such as works of art. Other countries provide exceptions that allow you to take and share such pictures.</p>
            
            <p>Next, ask participants to check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_panorama#/media/File:Freedom_of_Panorama_in_Europe_NC.svg">this map</a> or <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Freedom_of_panorama#/media/File:Freedom_of_Panorama_world_map.png">this map</a> to identify their home countries and to see if an exception exists where they are.</p>
            
            <p>Then ask participants for their reactions to what they discover about their local policies and, in general, to the idea of forbidding people from taking pictures of certain buildings or works in public spaces.</p>
            
            <p>The Freedom of Panorama is defined in Wikipedia as: an exception to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright">copyright</a> laws of various jurisdictions that permits taking photographs and video footage and creating other images (such as paintings) of buildings and sometimes sculptures and other art works which are permanently located in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_space">public place</a>, without infringing on any copyright that may otherwise subsist in such works, and the publishing of such images - for instance on Instagram, or Twitter. Panorama freedom statutes or case law limit the right of the copyright owner to take action for breach of copyright against the creators and distributors of such images. It is an exception to the normal rule that the copyright owner has the exclusive right to authorize the creation and distribution of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work">derivative works</a>.</p>
            
            <p>See this list of countries in the EU and around the world that haven’t yet added this exception to their copyright laws: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Freedom_of_panorama">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Freedom_of_panorama</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> this is not legal advice, but for educational purposes.</p>
            
            <p>Ask participants to consider the photographs they’ve taken as an argument for including a freedom of panorama exception across the EU within upcoming reforms.</p>
            
            <p>Next, invite participants share those images on social media using #makerparty.</p>
            
            <p>You can also make this more like a scavenger hunt by asking participants to take photos of specific things in their communities such as </p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>Public buildings and works of different colors, shapes, or sizes.</li>
              <li>Historic landmarks.</li>
              <li>Public artworks.</li>
              <li>Themed collections of places, like civic buildings or different kinds of restaurants or street food vendors.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>If you’d like to introduce an element of competition to such a treasure hunt, you can also assign point values to specific items on your checklist. You may want to award some Maker Party swag to the winner or winning team of photographers if you decide to run a competitive scavenger hunt, or have swag available for everyone who earns a certain number of points or contributes a certain amount of photos.</p>

            <p>Project a search or webpage that collects participants’ photos as they appear in social media streams for the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23makerparty&src=typd">#makerparty</a> hashtag.</p>
            
            <p>With the last 10-15 minutes of the activity, invite attendees to check out the photos they’ve collected together and to comment on them wherever you curate them for the event. Ask them to tell stories and ask one another questions to generate more content and context around the works they’ve just contributed to the commons. If time allows, see if they want to make any hyper-local members using the photos contributed by their peers and neighbors.</p>

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">5 minutes</div>

                <p>Facilitate a brief reflective discussion at the end of your event using prompts like these:
                
                <ul class="fancy">
                  <li>In your own words, describe the commons and reasons we need it.</li>
                  <li>In your own words, describe "freedom of panaorama" and why we should have it.</li>
                  <li>What are some other ways you can imagine contributing to the commons?</li>
                  <li>Should different countries treat one another’s commons differently? For example, should one country be able to ignore open licenses from another one?</li>
                  <li>Should it be illegal to host or share a picture that’s openly licensed in one country, but not in another?</li>
                  <li>Should a government be able to impose copyright on a work you created and shared openly?</li>
                </ol>
