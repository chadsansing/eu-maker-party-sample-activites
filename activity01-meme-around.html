          <li>
            <h1>Preparation</h1>
            
            <ol class="fancy">
              <li>Review your planning and facilitation materials.</li>
              <li>Review this activity before you run it.</li>
              <li>Gather your materials.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1>Hack Your Nametag &amp; Intros</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

            <p>Ask participants to create a nametag to wear during the event that captures an exhibit or performance project idea they have in support of common-sense copyright reform. Each participant can put their name and handle on one side and a question or project idea they have on the other. Then they can use your crafting materials to illustrate and/or illuminate either side or both sides with provided materials.</p>
            
            <p>With the next 5 minutes of the activity, participants go in a circle introducing themselves by sharing their names and questions or ideas with the group.</p>  
            
            <p>Finally, introduce the campaign with this <a href="https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/encrypt/codemoji/1">explainer video from Mozilla</a> [placeholder].</p> 

          </li> <!-- end of step-->
          
          <li>
            <h1>Meme-around</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">40 minutes</div>

            <p>Take 5-10 minutes to introduce the concept of the meme to your audience and share a little bit about its history. You may want to create some slides for this or use campaign materials. Include a few of your favorite memes that illustrate a combination of copyrighted or openly licensed material with new, textual content that changes the meaning of the original work. Ask your audience if they think this kind of use is fair and what they would think if memes became illegal because of unreasonable copyright protection. <strong>Note:</strong> not every meme is an example of fair use in the United States, but copyright law there doesn't prohibit all memes.</p>
            
            <p>You can use a Thimble project like <a href="https://thimbleprojects.org/karenlouisesmith/97028/">this one</a> or a popular meme generator like <a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator">imgflip</a> to make a meme.</p>

            <p>With the next 10 minutes, ask participants to find and share a favorite meme or two, but remind them that we are a diverse and inclusive group - they should be mindful about the memes they pick so as to account for others’ safety and comfort in the group.</p>
            
            <p>If you have a small event, have participants share their memes with the whole group. If you have a large event, have participants share in small groups of 4-5 people.</p>
            
            <p>Take another 20 minutes for participants to make their own copyright-themed memes using this project on Thimble, Mozilla’s online code editor, a meme generator they like, or a paper template you can print and share. If you event is low-fi or no-fi (with little or no internet connectivity), consider bringing print materials like magazines or newspapers for making paper memes.</p>
            
            <p>Unless you are in the UK, elsewhere in Europe you do not have a fair use or “Fair Dealing” clause regarding copyright that may protect you if you make derivative works like memes that feature copyrighted images. It might be safest where you are to have participants create paper-prototype meme with their own artwork, to have them upload their own images to use in an online meme maker, or to have them work with images already in the public domain.</p>
            
            <p>If local laws allow, encourage participants to share their memes on social media using the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23makerparty&src=typd">#makerparty</a> hashtag.</p>
           
          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">5 minutes</div>

                <p>Facilitate a brief reflective discussion at the end of your event using prompts like these:
                
                <ul class="fancy">
                  <li>Should memes be protected as fair use or free speech?</li>
                  <li>Should it be illegal to produce memes?</li>
                  <li>Should memes count as new creative works?</li>
                  <li>Should it be legal for people to remix other people’s pictures and quotes with memes?</li>
                  <li>Should it be illegal to host or share a meme you don’t create?</li>
                </ol>
