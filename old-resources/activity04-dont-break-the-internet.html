        <ul class="agenda">

            <h1>Preparation</h1>
            
            <ol class="fancy">
              <li>Review your planning and facilitation materials.</li>
              <li>Review this activity before you run it.</li>
              <li>Gather your materials.</li>

            <h1>Hack Your Nametag &amp; Intros</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

            <p>Ask participants to create a nametag to wear during the event that captures an exhibit or performance project idea they have in support of common-sense copyright reform. Each participant can put their name and handle on one side and a question or project idea they have on the other. Then they can use your crafting materials to illustrate and/or illuminate either side or both sides with provided materials.</p>
            
            <p>With the next 5 minutes of the activity, participants go in a circle introducing themselves by sharing their names and questions or ideas with the group.</p>  
            
            <p>Finally, introduce the campaign with this <a href="https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/encrypt/codemoji/1">explainer video from Mozilla</a> [placeholder].</p>

            <h1>Don't Break the Internet Option 1</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">60 minutes</div>

            <p>This option is for a 1-2 hour event that gets developers thinking about the ways code and copyright should interact. The aim is to brainstorm, ideate, and share paper prototypes of projects attendees and others could take further after the event.</p>
            
            <p>You should prepare a repo ahead of the event to host participants’ prototypes and/or code.</p>
            
            <p><strong>The big idea here is to help technologists find ways to demonstrate the importance of FLOSS, project stewardship of open projects, and reasonable copyright laws through interactive experiences online. </strong></p>
            
            <p>You should facilitate conversation and work about the need to steward and sustain open projects, as well as the need to fight unreasonable copyright reform. For example, when coders take down scripts that others use, they risk breaking the internet just as if others were blocked from using their code by copyright rules. You can share the case study of what happened when <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-kontny/what-sad-affleck-and-an-o_b_9682260.html">Azer Koçulu took down his node dependency left-pad</a> to illustrate this point and the need for robust open practices to complement better copyright rules.</p>
            
            <p>You and your participants should use the first part of your activity time to pitch ideas for <strong><em>websites, apps, and games that show what happens when restrictive copyright breaks the web</em></strong>, like:</p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>What it looks like when links go dark.</li>
              <li>What it looks like when popular services break because FLOSS resources are under attack or taken down at the request of corporations selling competing, proprietary products.</li>
              <li>What it looks like when popular services break because stewards stop supporting or hosting FLOSS projects online.</li>
              <li>What it looks like when open solutions solve copyright-connected problems.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <img src="images/error-message-1.png" width="90%" alt="An image of an error message saying a website cannot be found"><br>
            
            <p style="font-size:.9em;"><em>Error warning, <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/error-www-internet-calculator-101408/">CC0 Public Domain by geralt</a></em></p>
            
            <p>There aren’t pieces of software we’d want; rather <strong><em>they’re pieces of software that show what we might get along with restrictive copyright reform</em></strong>. Projects like this might include:</p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li><em>anti.blog</em> - a reader view add-on that lets you read content without links or linked or embedded media.</li>
              <li><em>badmail/badpost</em> - an add-on that redacts all mention of potentially copyrighted materials in your email and/or social media posts.</li>
              <li><em>untextr</em> - a texting service that doesn’t let you share media or links in sms messages.</li>
              <li><em>It Came from Beyond Copyright</em> - a pixel adventure game about open values or something like a fork of Fight for the Open Web!, a game built inside Minecraft that teaches about the open web.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Alternately, you could prototype more helpful software that helps keep the internet open and functional with well-applied copyright and sharing licenses, like:</p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li><em>AutoSteward</em> - a script or library for identifying widely used FLOSS projects that could use more widely distributed mirroring and hosting to ensure continuity of service.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You can divide time for the activity like this:</p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>Brainstorming ideas. (10 minutes)</li>
              <li>Designing and ideating paper prototypes. (40 minutes)</li>
              <li>Sharing prototypes and curating them online for continued development. (10 minutes)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Invite attendees to share their prototypes on social media, as well, using the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23makerparty&src=typd">#makerparty</a> hashtag.</p>
           
          </li> <!-- end of step-->

          <li>
            <h1>Don't Break the Internet Option 2</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">180 minutes</div>
            
            <p>This option is for an extended workshop building off of participants’ prototyping work from Option 1.</p>
            
            <p>Follow the same steps in Option 1, but then provide a break before more workshop time. Think of Option 2 like a hack jam, hackathon, or multi-day event to foster the development and deployment of coded built from attendees’ prototypes.</p>
            
            <p>To see an example of a hackathon program and its supporting materials, check out the <a href="http://2016.euhackathon.eu/">EUHackathon 2016</a> website.</p>
            
            <p>While you may not organize an event of the same scope, pieces like its schedule can help you structure your own hackathon event.</p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>Brainstorm using the steps from Option 1 (60 minutes)</li>
              <li>Break (10 minutes)</li>
              <li>Workshop Time (120+ minutes)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Over the course of the next few hours, or between shorter events across several days, host the work participants need to do to carry their prototypes to online implementation.</p>
            
            <p>Provide at least 2-3 hours of additional work time and plan for a share-around or demo fair at the end of the event. Reserve at least a half an hour for a small group to share its work, but plan for a longer wrap-up if you have a large group of developers participating in your event.</p>
            
            <p>Invite attendees to share their products on social media, as well, using the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23makerparty&src=typd">#makerparty</a> hashtag.</p>
            
          </li> <!-- end of step-->


          <li>
            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">5 minutes</div>

                <p>Facilitate a brief “I need/I can offer” reflection with the group. Use a prompt like this to have participants reflect on the event and how they can help each other move their projects forward:</p>
                
                <blockquote>To continue developing my app, I need _____ . To help you develop yours, I can offer _____.</blockquote>
