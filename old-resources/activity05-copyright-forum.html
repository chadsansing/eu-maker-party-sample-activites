            <h1>Hack Your Nametag &amp; Intros</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">15 minutes</div>

            <p>Ask participants to create a nametag to wear during the event that captures an exhibit or performance project idea they have in support of common-sense copyright reform. Each participant can put their name and handle on one side and a question or project idea they have on the other. Then they can use your crafting materials to illustrate and/or illuminate either side or both sides with provided materials.</p>
            
            <p>With the next 5 minutes of the activity, participants go in a circle introducing themselves by sharing their names and questions or ideas with the group.</p>  
            
            <p>Finally, introduce the campaign with this <a href="https://advocacy.mozilla.org/en-US/encrypt/codemoji/1">explainer video from Mozilla</a> [placeholder].</p>

            <h1>Option 1: Copyright Panel</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">40 minutes</div>

            <p>Invite three guests to share brief, 10-minute talks about the history and nature of copyright, answering key questions:</p>
            
            <ol class="fancy">
              <li><strong>Speaker one:</strong> Where did copyright come from? How can it be helpful if it’s properly applied? How is it harmful when it’s too restrictive? Your speaker might want to emulate something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fdUDecJ6jc">this video</a> telling copyright’s story.</li>
              <li><strong>Speaker two:</strong> Where are we now? What’s the current state of copyright across the EU? What’s the current state of copyright where we live? What copyright issues do we face? How can we get involved in fighting for reform?</li>
              <li><strong>Speaker three:</strong> What would it be like to live in a near- or far-future world without copyright or in a world where copyright becomes supremely restrictive? What changes in the EU might foster innovation or stifle it?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Consider inviting speakers from fields that regularly encounter copyright issues such as</p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>Artists.</li>

              <li>Scholars.</li>
              <li>Scientists.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>After the talks, facilitate  a 10-minute Q&amp;A session between your audience and panelists.</p>

            <h1>Option 2: Super Slide Showdown</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">40 minutes</div>
            
            <p>Invite 3 speakers to deliver <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk">lightning talks</a> on issues related to copyright. You should decide on a format for the lightning talks ahead of time, share it with speakers, and get their slides before your event so you can create a master slide deck and moderate.</p>
            
            <ul class="fancy">
              <li>One speaker should use slides with copyrighted images. They should get permissions before the talk to use them or be sure of local fair use criteria.</li>
              <li>One speaker should use slides with images that are openly licensed, such as images shared with <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses.</li>
              <li>One speaker should use slides with images that are in the local public domain.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Consider inviting speakers from fields that regularly encounter copyright issues such as</p>

            </ul>
            
            <p>At the end of the talks, audience members should do a shout-out or more formal vote on which lightning talk they think used which kind of image.</p>

            <p>With the remaining time in the activity, speakers should share out which kind of images they used and talk about how the constraints they faced shaped their speech.</p>
            
            <p>You can also facilitate a brief Q&amp;A between your audience and speakers regarding copyright if time permits.</p>

            <h1>Experience the Issues</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">20 minutes</div>
            
            <p>This menu of activities lets you to differentiate for your audience. Pick an activity that you think speaks to your audience or design your own.</p>
            
            <ol class="fancy">
              
              <li><strong>Copyright treasure hunt:</strong> Form two teams of participants. One team can begin searching for prizes or items you’ve hidden around your event space and communicate with one another. The other team has to somehow “pay” you first for a copyrighted map or set of instructions (which might omit some items or includes ones the open team is never likely to find) that will lead them to the prizes or items. Maybe they have to draw play money or put ten “like” stickers/sticky notes each on an article or blog post you print and tape up in the room. The idea is to compare and contrast open, crowd-sourced approaches to problem solving vs. copyrighted solutions you have to somehow buy from others. The team that finds the most prizes or items wins at the end of 15 minutes. Follow up on a 5 minute debrief about the advantages and disadvantages of working with open documentation/problem-solving vs. working with copyrighted, licensed solutions.</li>
              
              <li><strong>Free local art:</strong> Send participants out into the community for 15 minutes to document and share as many art pieces and projects as they can find and record without running afoul of local copyright law. Have them post their pictures across social media using a common hashtag for curation into an ad-hoc online exhibit. As participants return, use the last 5 minutes to facilitate a conversation about the impacts of openness and copyright on artistic media.</li>
              
              <li><strong>“An internet without links” performance skits:</strong> Form groups of 4-5 participants. Give them 10 minutes each to create a skit that shows what would happen in a world without links or the permission to quote public figures. Take the last 10 minutes for groups to perform their skits for one another. Facilitate a brief closing conversation about common concerns or issues raised across all the performances.</li>
              
            </ol>
            
            <p>Throughout the activity, encourage participants to share what they find or make on social media using the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23makerparty&src=typd">#makerparty</a> hashtag.</p>

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <div class="time step-time">10 minutes</div>

                <p>Facilitate a brief reflective discussion at the end of your event using prompts like these:
                
                <ul class="fancy">
                  <li>What would it be like to navigate and share parts of an internet locked down by bad copyright reform? What would you lose if we all lost the right to copy, link, or quote content?</li>
                  <li>Would you be happy paying for copyrighted content that people aren’t allowed to share openly with you? Why or why not?</li>
                  <li>Should copyright reform continue to make it legal to copyright pictures of public works or works, like famous buildings, that are more or less always in public?</li>
                  <li>Do you think the way we handle copyright now is the way its creators intended it? What changes would you make to existing copyright laws?</li>
                  <li>Would you rather live in a heavily copyrighted or heavily shared future? Why?</li>
                </ol>
